Improvements
----------------




Improvements :

The solution works but given more time the following improvements can be made :

Split up the SainsburysScraper to handle different sections e.g. a method to get the product Title ,method to get the unit price.
In the future if the process to change getting the product title changes it would mean just changing the code only in the related method.

Move the HTML look up tags to a separate class or a properties file so if they change it can be updated from one place.	

In the SainsburysScraper move the HTML tags to variables/properties files so they can be changed easily or create methods to take in the tags to allow methods to be reused.

Add methods in the SiteScraper to handle extracting text values from the element(s) it can also check for null values. 
E.g. "productElement.selectFirst("div.productInfo div.productNameAndPromotions").text()" currently does not check for null or empty values.
This needs adding in to check for nulls or a method in the site scraper to handle the process.

Allow the console to take in a site URL so a new site can be scraped or move the URL to a properties file.

In the ProductFile model remove the toJSONObj() , move it to a separate class to handle the converting. This can then be updated in the future to allow for the product data to be extracted to different formats (csv,xml). Also makes it easier to be extended for different solutions e.g. an another system may want the kcal value even if its 0.

The URL could also do with being validated first before it is used.

The looking up of the kcal value needs to be more robust, it’s reliant upon the row containing the text "kcal". Checks could be to scan the table & check the value is based on per "100g" & nothing else. The kcal value doesn't have a guaranteed index in the nutritionTable so it should can the whole table looking for the value & if it is possible 2 or matches are found there should be some sort of priority to determine which is more accurate.

Looking up the product description is reliant on the description being in the first div.productText on the page, there are multiple div.productText in the page so as an added check to ensure the correct value for the description is found you need the look for a h3 with the value "Description" if the dev.productText is after this then it is more likely to be the description.

Not sure what the extended use of the application is , maybe to scrape the website then validate the site information is displaying correctly to what is in the main Sainsburys product database to ensure pricing , kcal details, etc are correct. For this it would be better to store the retrieved data in a database.

Could add the option to export the extracted data to a file.

A JSON Validator to ensure the output is in a valid format.

Alot more unit testing is required to ensure the data is being scraped accurately. Mock web sites need to be created which can then be used for testing. Frameworks like mockito can be added mock objects for more robust testing.

Use Maven or Ant to automate the build process to build the jar & include any dependencies.




Stories
----------------

Stories:

Story : As a Sainsburys pricing analyst I want a console application to scan the Sainsburys website & return product details in JSON Format.

Scenario : User is able to run a console application which will return them product data in JSON Format.


Story : As a Sainsburys pricing analyst if the kcal value is missing when scraping the website I don't want to see the field in the JSON.

Scenario : if the kcal value was not available when the site was scraped the field should not be include in the JSON data.
Scenario : kcal value was on the site it should be included into the JSON.

Story : As a Sainsburys pricing analyst I do not want to see "Sainsbury’s Klip Lock Storage Set" data in the JSON results.
Scenario : Klip lock data should not be scraped or included into the JSON Data

Story : As a Sainsburys pricing analyst all unit pricing should be formatted to 2 decimal places to show pounds & pence clearly.
Scenario : Pricing should be formatted to 2 decimal places.

Story : As a Sainsburys pricing analyst I want to see the total of all the items scraped from the site.
Scenario : JSON data should include a total field which contains the sum of all unit prices scraped.

Story : As a Sainsburys pricing analyst if the description on the site is spread along multiple lines I only want to see the first line in the JSON data.
Scenario : If multiple lines are available when scraping the description only include the first line.
